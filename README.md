This Python script creates a basic calculator GUI using the Tkinter library. Here are the main capabilities of the code:

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Buttons for these operations are provided on the GUI, and when clicked, they append the corresponding operator to the expression.

2. Clear Button: There is a "Clear" button that clears the expression field.

3. Decimal Point: The calculator allows input of decimal numbers. The decimal point button inserts a decimal point into the expression.

4. Mathematical Functions: The calculator provides buttons for basic mathematical functions such as square root, sine, cosine, and tangent. Additionally, there is a button labeled "INV" to toggle between the inverse and regular trigonometric functions.

5. Error Handling: The calculator handles errors such as division by zero and displays "Error" in the expression field.

6. Entry Field: The entry field allows users to input numerical values and displays the current expression.

7. Inverted Trigonometric Functions: The calculator offers both regular and inverse trigonometric functions. When the "INV" button is clicked, the trigonometric functions change to their inverse counterparts (e.g., sin -> sin^-1).

8. Resizable Grid Layout: The buttons and entry field are arranged in a grid layout using the grid method, allowing for flexibility in resizing the GUI window.

9. Custom Styling: The buttons are styled with different colors and text to enhance visibility and usability.

Overall, this code provides a simple yet functional calculator interface with support for basic arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions.
